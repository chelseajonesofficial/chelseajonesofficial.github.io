    <h2>lyrics</h2>
    <p>i'll find peace in hoping youre peaceful</p>
    <p>if it'll help ease the knowing you're gone</p>
    <p>and the pieces of me that are grateful</p>
    <p>outnumber the pieces of you that i lost</p>
    <p>and i'm famously bad at the time thing</p>
    <p>so i'll tell my sister it's only the timing</p>
    <p>but when i say that i'm lucky </p>
    <p>to love you from a distance</p>
    <p>it's the same way i'm lucky</p>
    <p>to know of saturns existence</p>
    <p>  </p>
    <p>  </p>
    <p>i'll take blame for how it all ended</p>
    <p>but it'll still break me to drive home alone</p>
    <p>'cuz the places we've been are all tainted</p>
    <p>by all of the places that we'll never go</p>
    <p>and i've always been good at complaining</p>
    <p>so i'll admit it that this time it's more of the same thing</p>
    <p>but i'll still say that i'm lucky </p>
    <p>to love you from a distance</p>
    <p>in the same way i'm lucky</p>
    <p>to know of saturns existence</p>
    <h2>Behind the Song</h2>
    <p>my best friend casually dropped this absolute bar "we're so lucky to know about saturn". and that hit really hard. i'll never see saturn from up close, but it's beautiful to know it's out there. saturn is this beautiful soul that i almost had, but i lost her. I'm still so grateful to know she's there and to hope she's ok, but i'm forced to stay away. i wrote the song within a couple days, and texted the wonderful Grace Budge to record it with me. this is one of the most meaningful things i've ever done for myself. and now i'm sharing it with you. i hope you love it as much as i do</p>
